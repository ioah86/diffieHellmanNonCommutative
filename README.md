Diffie Hellman -- Non commutative version
==================================================

In this repository, one can find a version of the Diffie-Hellman
protocol using a non-commutative domain. A publication about this
protocol is being written up and will appear soon.

In order to compile and run the file, simply use the command

```

We are looking forward to feedback from users.
